README for Startup Scripts.

The startup scripts provided here are suggested scripts
which should make it much easier to both system administators
deploying DBMail and distribution packagers interested in
providing prebuilt DBMail packages for their distributions.

Currently provided are Debian, Gentoo and RedHat style scripts.
The Debian scripts should work without modification on Ubuntu.
The RedHat scripts should work on Mandrake, SuSe and so on.

If you find any of these scripts to be lacking for your
distribution of choice, please consult the DBMail mailing
lists for help updating the closest compatible scripts and
submit them to be included in future versions of DBMail.
