dbmail for Debian


-----------------

Before you can run dbmail you will have to create the database,
create the required tables and grant access to the user specified 
in dbmail.conf.

If you are upgrading from dbmail-1.2 you will find that the sql tables 
have changed and are incompatible with dbmail-2.x. Migration scripts
for your database backend are provided in the examples directory. None
of the dbmail-2 binaries will run until you have upgraded your database.

The debian package runs dbmail-deliver as user dbmail via suid.
This will allow normal users to insert mail through dbmail-deliver
(i.e. from procmail) without granting them access to dbmail.conf
and the password contained therein.
