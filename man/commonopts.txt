COMMON OPTIONS
--------------
-f configfile::
 Specify an alternate config file. The utilities are currently
 hardcoded to use /etc/dbmail.conf for their configs, and will
 halt if the config file cannot be found. Use the -f configfile
 option to specify your system's preferred config file location.
 Debian is patched to have /etc/dbmail/dbmail.conf as the default.

-q::
 Quietly skip interactive prompts and helpful status messages
 which would otherwise be printed to stdout. Use two -q's to
 silence errors which would otherwise be printed to stderr.

-v::
 Operate verbosely. Some of the utilities in the DBMail suite
 can take two -v's for extra verbosity. Those which don't understand
 this convention won't complain about having the extra -v
 and will simply operate at their normal verbosity.

-V::
 Show the version and copyright, then exit.

-h::
 Show a brief summary of options, then exit.
