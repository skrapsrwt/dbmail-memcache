DBMAIL-UTIL(8)
==============


NAME
----
dbmail-util - maintains the integrity and cleanliness of the DBMail
datatables.

SYNOPSIS
--------
dbmail-util [-actubpds] [-l time] [-yn] [-qvVh] [-f configFile]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The dbmail-util program does a global database cleanup and integrity
check. All messages that are set for deletion will be marked for final
deletion (status 3). All message that are marked for final deletion
will be cleared from the database. The integrity check will check for
unconnected messageblocks, unconnected messages and unconnected 
mailboxes.

By default, the checks run in a read-only mode, possibly prompting to make
changes. Pass the -n option to respond no to any prompts. Pass the -y option
to make read-write changes, responding yes to any prompts.

As DBMail matures and new features are added, additional check modes will be
added. In addition, more prompts may be added for different situations where
changes need to be committed to the database. We recommend using the -a option
to run all checks and using the -n and -y options if you expect no prompts.

OPTIONS
-------

-a::
 Perform all checks listed below. This option will be kept up-to-date
 with additional checks available in future versions.

-c::
 Clean up unlinked message entries.

-t::
 Test for message integrity.

-u::
 Null message check.

-b::
 Check and rebuild the body/header/envelope cache tables.

-p::
 Purge messages with DELETE status. To purge messages currently marked
 \Deleted, run with the -pd options twice. This is not recommended; it is
 better to leave a grace period for old messages before permanently wiping
 them from the database.

-d::
 Set DELETE status for messages flagged \Deleted by IMAP or POP3.

-s::
 Remove dangling/invalid aliases and forwards.

-r time::
 Clear the reply cache used for autoreplies and Sieve vacations. The time is
 specified as <hours>h<minutes>m (don't include the angle brackets, though!).

-l time::
 Clear the IP log used for IMAP/POP-before-SMTP. The time is specified as
 <hours>h<minutes>m (don't include the angle brackets, though!).

-M::
 migrate legacy 2.2.x messageblks to mimeparts table.

-m limit::
 limit number of physmessages migrated. Default 10000 per run.

-n::
 Show the intended repairs without making any changes, i.e. no to all.

-y::
 Perform all repair actions , i.e. yes to all.

-i:: 
 Enter an interactive user management console in some future version
 where this feature is implemented. It is not currently available.

--rehash::
 Rebuild the hash values for all the message parts in the database. You 
 need to run this after modifying the hash_algorithm config option.
