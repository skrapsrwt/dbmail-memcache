dbmail-users { -a username | -c username } [ -g clientid ] [ -m maxmail]
	[ -p passwordtype ] [ -P shadowfile ] [ -w password ] [ -W passwordfile]
	[ -u username ] [ -s aliases ] [ -S aliases ]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The dbmail-users program enables you to manage the DBMail users. It
lets you add, delete and change users as well as show information about
a specific user or display a list of existing users. It also has the
capability of adding/removing separate aliases.


MODE OPTIONS
------------
-a  user::
  Add a user

-d  user::
  Delete a user

-c  user::
  Change details for a user

-e  user::
  Empty all mailboxes for a user

-l  uspec::
  List information for matching users

-x  alias::
  Create an external forwarding address


MINOR OPTIONS
-------------
-w  passwd::
  Specify user's password on the command line

-W  [file]::
  Read from a file or prompt for a user's password

-p  pwtype::
  Password type may be one of the following: plaintext, crypt,
  md5-hash, md5-digest, crypt-raw, md5-hash-raw, md5-digest-raw,
  md5-base64, md5-base64-raw.

-P  [file]::
  Pull encrypted password from the shadow file

-u  user::
  New username (only useful for -c, change)

-g  cid::
  Assign the user to a client group.

-m  max::
  Set the maximum mail quota in <bytes>B, <kbytes>K, or <mbytes>M,
  default in bytes If set to 0, there will be no limit.

-s  alias[,alias...]::
  Adds a list of recipient aliases. An alias is an e-mail address
  that is being delivered to the DBMail mailsystem and should be
  delivered to this user.

-S  alias[,alias...]::
  Removes a list of recipient aliases. Use wildcards ? and * to match any
  single character and any number of characters, respectively.

-t  forward[,forward...]::

ALIASES VS. FORWARDS
--------------------

One question we often see on the dbmail@dbmail.org mailing list is what the
difference is between aliases and forwards.
When using dbmail-users, the different command line options are there
because an alias attaches some arbitrary address to a particular user's
account, while a forward attaches some arbitrary address another
arbitrary address or pipe out.


When using dbmail-users with major option -c, you must use minor option -s/-S
for modifying aliases. When using dbmail-users with major option -x, you must
use -t/-T for modifying forwards.

ALIASES
-------

When creating a new user account, you must either add an initial alias that
delivers to the account name, or make the account in the form
of a fully qualified email address. For example, the user named 'Baz' created
like this:

  dbmail-users -a baz -p crypt -w psword

will *not* actually receive any mail yet! You must be sure to add an alias:

  dbmail-users -c baz -s baz@foodomain

You may add multiple aliases by repeatedly calling the dbmail-users(8)
utility, or by calling it with a comma-separated list of aliases:

  dbmail-users -c baz -s baz@foodomain,baz@bardomain

Three catch-all modes are also supported, for domains, sub-domains, and local parts:

  dbmail-users -a baz -s @bazdomain

  dbmail-users -a baz -s @.allsubs.bazdomain
 
  dbmail-users -a baz -s baz@

The first example catches email addressed to any user @bazdomain and delivers it
to Baz's INBOX. The second example catch email address to any user at any
subdomain below .allsubs.bazdomain (*not* including allsubs.bazdomain
itself!) The third example catches email addressed to baz@ at any domain.

There is no support for delivering to a particular mailbox other than INBOX
via the aliases system. Please use a Sieve script to sort mail like this.


FORWARDS
--------

Incoming messages addressed to particular email addresses can be forwarded out
to outside email addresses, piped out to a command (when prepended with |
'pipe') or piped out with an mbox-style From line to a command (when prepended
with ! 'bang'). For example:

  dbmail-users -x bar@domain -t bar@another.domain
 
  dbmail-users -x bar@domain -t "|/usr/sbin/superspamtrapper"
 
  dbmail-users -x bar@domain -t "!cat > /var/spool/mail/bar/whatever.mbox"

Forwards can be listed using the same -l command as for users. For example,
to see where the local address bar@domain might be forwarded to, use this:

  dbmail-users -l bar@domain
    forward [bar@domain] to [bar@another.domain]
    forward [bar@domain] to [|/usr/sbin/superspamtrapper]
    forward [bar@domain] to [!cat > /var/spool/mail/bar/whatever.mbox]


Forwards can be removed using basic glob style pattern matching.  A ?
'question' means "match zero or one of any character" and * 'asterisk' means
"match zero or more of any character." For example:

  dbmail-users -x bar@domain -T "*"

will complete and totally remove the 'bar@domain' external alias and all of
its forwarding addresses and commands.
