OPTIONS
-------

-p pidfile::
  Specify an alternate pid file. The daemons are currently hardcoded
  to use /var/run/dbmail-<daemon> for their pid files, and will halt
  if the pid file cannot be written. Use the -p pidfile option to
  place the pid file in your system's preferred location.

-n::
  No daemonize: inetd mode. The program remains attached to the console from
  which it was started and will read and write on stdin/stdout. This is quite
  useful for debugging when combined with the -v option. It is also used for
  running from (x)inetd.

-D::
  No daemonize: init mode. The program remains attached to the console and will
  listen on the network sockets defined in dbmail.conf. This is mostly used 
  when running from inittab or under the control of daemontools.
