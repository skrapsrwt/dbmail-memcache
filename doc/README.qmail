Using DBMail with QMail
=======================

Thanks to Edward Allen for this information. Note that this information
is quite old. If you have more recent information on QMail please join
the dev mailing list or file a bug with the project.


1.	Prerequisites

	* A DBMail installation
	* A QMail installation

2.	Add the domain you wish to receive mail for to
	/var/qmail/control/rcpthosts. For example, you can add
	
	example.com

	(yes, only that :) ) to /var/qmail/control/rcpthosts

3.	Add delivery information to /var/qmail/control/virtualdomains:
	
	example.com:dbmail

	where 'dbmail' is the dbmail system user you chose. If the file 
	virtualdomains doesn't exist you have to create it.
	
4.	Make sure the file /var/qmail/control/locals exists and is empty.

5.	Now create a dot-qmail file in the dbmail home directory called 
	.qmail-default that contains the next single line:

	|/usr/local/sbin/dbmail-deliver -d ${RECIPIENT:7}

	The pipe tells qmail to pipe the email through a command.  The 
	${RECIPIENT:7} takes the environment variable $RECIPIENT and chops off
	the first seven characters.  This is needed because the value of 
	RECIPIENT is dbmail-the_e-mail_address (for example: 
	dbmail-john@example.com or dbmail-frank@example.com). 
	
	If your dbmail user is not dbmail, you'll need to change the 7 to 
	the number of characters in your dbmail user's name plus one (the 
	dash '-' after the dbmail user's name). So, if the dbmail user's 
	name you chose is joe, your .qmail-default file should contain:

	|/usr/local/sbin/dbmail-deliver -d ${RECIPIENT:4}
	
	For more information about dot-qmail files please check the 
	man page of dot-qmail, you can check it online at: 
	http://www.qmail.org/man/man5/dot-qmail.html. Pay special 
	attention to the section 'Extension Addresses'.
	

Note: 	Right now Qmail (the most recent version of Qmail at the time of 
	this writing is netqmail-1.05) has no support for the protocol LMTP, 
	so you can't use dbmail-lmtp with Qmail in an "easy" way (as you do 
	with Postfix).
