DBMail THANKS file

DBMail has originally been written by Eelco van Beek, Roel Rozendaal
and Ilja Booij. Development since 2.0 is led by Paul J Stevens and 
Aaron Stone.

Special thanks to Metaways.net for providing resources so dbmail runs
on Solaris, and to InternetConnection.net for providing the original
sqlite driver.

Many people further contributed to DBMail by reporting problems, 
suggesting various improvements and submitting code patches.
